Here lies the documentation for Hilbish, the hyper extensible Lua shell.  
Hilbish provides you with a few quality of life features and useful
functions to ensure you can make the shell fully yours.

These features include:
- Completion and history search menus
- Hinting and syntax highlighting (scripted by user)

# Installation
Steps on installing Hilbish will be at the Install page in the navigation bar
at the top. This also included getting development builds from the GitHub
repository.
